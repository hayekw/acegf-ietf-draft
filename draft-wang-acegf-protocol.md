--- abstract

This document specifies the Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative
Framework (ACE-GF), a cryptographic construction for deriving and
reconstructing stable digital identities from user-held credentials
without requiring persistent storage of a master secret.

ACE-GF addresses a structural limitation of existing deterministic
key-derivation and identity systems, which rely on long-lived root
secrets and rigid derivation hierarchies.  By separating identity
reconstruction from long-term secret storage, ACE-GF enables stateless
identity recovery, credential rekeying, and context-isolated derivation
across multiple cryptographic algorithms.

The framework is designed to be application-agnostic and may be applied
to diverse environments such as authentication systems, distributed
identities, secure key management, and cryptographic wallets.  This
document defines the core construction, security properties, and
interoperability considerations of ACE-GF, while application-specific
profiles are defined separately.

# Introduction

## Background and Motivation

Deterministic key management schemes, such as BIP-32 and BIP-39,
have simplified key recovery by deriving keys from a single
[cite_start]master seed[cite: 18]. However, these schemes rely on the
long-term persistent storage of that seed, which constitutes
[cite_start]a single point of failure (SPOF)[cite: 19, 20]. If the seed
[cite_start]is compromised, all derived keys are irreversibly exposed[cite: 21].

This storage-centric design is ill-suited for Autonomous
Digital Entities (ADEs), such as AI agents and IoT deployments,
which require identity continuity without centralized trust
[cite_start]anchors[cite: 22, 23]. ACE-GF addresses these challenges
by decoupling deterministic identity from long-term secret
[cite_start]storage[cite: 25].

## Core Contributions

ACE-GF introduces a generative framework for Atomic
Cryptographic Entities (ACE) with the following properties:

* **Seed-Storage-Free**: The identity root (REV) exists only
[cite_start]ephemerally in memory[cite: 29].
* **Deterministic Reconstruction**: The REV is reconstructed
[cite_start]from a sealed artifact and authorization credentials[cite: 30].
* **Context Isolation**: Cryptographic keys are isolated
across algorithms (e.g., Ed25519, PQC) using explicit
[cite_start]context encoding[cite: 33].

## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

The following terms are used throughout this document:

**ACE-GF**
: Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework. A cryptographic
framework that enables deterministic reconstruction of digital
identities from user-held credentials without requiring persistent
storage of a master secret.

**Credential**
: A user-provided secret input to ACE-GF, such as a passphrase, mnemonic,
or other high-entropy material. Credentials are supplied at the time of
identity reconstruction and are not persistently stored by the
framework.

**Identity**
: A stable cryptographic identity derived via ACE-GF. An identity may
correspond to one or more public/private key pairs, addresses, or
identifiers, depending on the application context in which ACE-GF is
applied.

**Context**
: An explicit domain-separation parameter used by ACE-GF to ensure that
derived material for different purposes, algorithms, or applications
remains cryptographically isolated.

**Rekeying**
: The process of changing credentials associated with an existing
identity while preserving the underlying identity semantics. In ACE-GF,
rekeying does not require persistent state or regeneration of the
identity.

**Profile**
: A specification that defines how ACE-GF is applied within a specific
application domain. Profiles may impose additional constraints,
parameters, or output formats, but do not modify the core ACE-GF
construction defined in this document.

**Wallet Application Profile**
: An application profile that applies ACE-GF to cryptocurrency wallet
systems, including multi-algorithm key derivation and migration from
legacy wallet formats. This profile is illustrative and does not
constrain other applications of ACE-GF.

# Protocol Overview

This section provides a high-level, non-normative overview of the ACE-GF
framework. It establishes the mental model for the decoupled architecture
before the detailed protocol specification in Section 4.

## The Decoupled Identity Model

ACE-GF operates on the principle of **Functional Decoupling**. Unlike
traditional deterministic systems that require the persistent storage
of a master seed, ACE-GF separates the identity into two logically
independent pipelines:

* **Authorization Pipeline (The "Lock")**: Manages the transformation
between a user's volatile **Credential** and a persistent **Sealed
Artifact (SA)**. It controls *access* to the identity.
* **Identity Pipeline (The "Key")**: Performs deterministic derivation
from the reconstructed **Root Entropy Value (REV)** to various
cryptographic algorithms. It defines the *substance* of the identity.

## Data Flow and Transformation

The following diagram illustrates how entropy flows from a raw state,
through the authorization lock, and into algorithm-specific keys:

    Authorization Pipeline            Identity Pipeline

## Atomic Entity Lifecycle and States

The lifecycle of an ACE is defined by the availability and reachability
of the Root Entropy Value (REV).

### Operational States

| State | Description | Persistence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sealed** | The REV is encrypted within a Sealed Artifact (SA). | Persistent (Disk/Storage) |
| **Reconstructed** | The REV is unsealed and resides in volatile memory. | Ephemeral (RAM only) |
| **Zeroized** | Sensitive material has been wiped. Identity is dormant. | N/A |
| **Unreachable** | The SA is destroyed or Credentials lost. | Permanent (Revoked) |

### 2.3.2. Lifecycle Sequence

1.  **Generate**: A 256-bit REV is sampled from a CSPRNG.
2.  **Seal**: The REV is encrypted with a key derived from a Credential
and Salt, producing a **Sealed Artifact (SA)**. The raw REV is then zeroized.
3.  **Unseal**: When an operation is required, the user provides the
Credential to decrypt the SA, restoring the REV to RAM.
4.  **Derive**: The REV is used to generate keys for specific contexts
(e.g., Ed25519, ML-DSA).
5.  **Zeroize**: Once complete, the REV and all derived material are
wiped from RAM.

## 2.4. Core Operations: Rekeying and Revocation

By decoupling authorization from identity, ACE-GF enables critical
operations without changing underlying cryptographic identifiers
(e.g., blockchain addresses):

* **Stateless Rekeying**: To change a password, the entity unseals the
REV and re-seals it using a *new* Credential and *new* Salt. The REV
remains invariant; thus, all derived public keys remain stable.
* **Revocation by Unreachability**: An identity is effectively revoked
by destroying the SA or the credential components. Without these, the
REV is mathematically lost, rendering the identity permanently offline
without requiring external revocation lists (CRLs).

## 2.5. Local Call Sequence

The following sequence describes the typical interaction between an
application ("Caller") and an ACE-GF implementation:

    Caller                         ACE-GF Implementation
      |                                     |
      |----- 1. generate_rev() ------------>| (Samples CSPRNG)
      |<------ [REV in RAM] ----------------|
      |                                     |
      |----- 2. seal_rev(REV, Cred) ------->| (Argon2id + AES-GCM-SIV)
      |<----- [Sealed Artifact (SA)] -------| (Store to disk)
      |                                     |
      |----- 3. zeroize_memory() ---------->| (Wipe RAM)
      |                                     |
      | ... later (identity usage) ...      |
      |                                     |
      |----- 4. unseal_rev(SA, Cred) ------>| (Reconstructs REV in RAM)
      |----- 5. derive_key(REV, Ctx) ------>| (HKDF-SHA256)
      |<----- [Derived Key Material] -------|
      |----- 6. zeroize_memory() ---------->| (Wipe RAM)

# Architecture and Design Principles

ACE-GF separates the identity lifecycle into two distinct pipelines:

## Identity Pipeline
The identity pipeline manages the transformation from the REV to
application-specific keys. It utilizes a deterministic, one-way
derivation function (HKDF) combined with explicit context strings.
This ensures that compromise of a specific child key (e.g., an
Ed25519 signing key) does not leak information about the REV or
other sibling keys.

## Authorization Pipeline
The authorization pipeline manages the secure "sealing" and
"unsealing" of the REV. By utilizing Argon2id for memory-hard
key stretching and AES-GCM-SIV for nonce-misuse resistant
encryption, the framework ensures that the REV is only
accessible when the correct Credential is provided.

# Cryptographic Primitives

The ACE-GF framework relies on industry-proven cryptographic primitives.
Implementations MUST strictly adhere to the selection of these primitives
to ensure deterministic consistency across different platforms and
environments.

## KDF1: Credential Hashing (Argon2id)

To resist offline brute-force attacks, ACE-GF utilizes the Argon2id
algorithm [RFC9106] for stretching user-provided credentials (Cred) into
a symmetric sealing key (K_seal).

* **Algorithm Selection**: Implementations MUST use the Argon2id variant
(as opposed to Argon2i or Argon2d) to provide optimized protection
against both side-channel attacks and GPU-based cracking.
* **Parameter Negotiation**: Implementations SHOULD support pre-defined
Sealing Profiles that specify memory cost (M), time iterations (T),
and parallelism (P).
* **Salt**: Each Sealed Artifact (SA) MUST include a unique 128-bit
random salt to ensure that identical credentials result in unique
sealing keys.

## AEAD: Sealing Encryption (AES-GCM-SIV)

ACE-GF employs AES-GCM-SIV [RFC8452] for the authenticated encryption
of the Root Entropy Value (REV).

* **Misuse Resistance**: AES-GCM-SIV is selected for its Synthetic
Initialization Vector (SIV) properties. In the specific context of
ACE-GF, given that the REV is a 256-bit high-entropy random value,
using a fixed 96-bit all-zero nonce (N_fixed) is safe under the
assumption that the plaintext (REV) is a uniformly random,
high-entropy value and that the sealing key is not reused for
arbitrary plaintexts. This assumption holds exclusively for the
sealing of REV values and MUST NOT be generalized to arbitrary data
encryption use cases.
* **Security Assurance**: The use of AES-GCM-SIV prevents confidentiality
leaks even in cases of nonce reuse, eliminating the dependency on
high-fidelity hardware Random Number Generators (RNG) during every
sealing operation.
* **Data Structure**: The encryption process MUST produce a 256-bit
ciphertext and a 128-bit authentication tag.

## KDF2: Key Derivation (HKDF-SHA256)

For deriving algorithm-specific keys from the REV, ACE-GF utilizes
HKDF [RFC5869].

* **Core Logic**: The standard Extract-then-Expand workflow is followed.
* **Extract**: Map the REV into a cryptographically strong
Pseudorandom Key (PRK).
* **Expand**: Input the structured Context tuple (Ctx) as the
'info' parameter to generate target keys of specific lengths.
* **Hash Function**: SHA-256 MUST be used.
* **Isolation Guarantee**: By explicitly encoding AlgID, Domain, and
Index into the 'info' string, HKDF ensures that the resulting
child keys are computationally independent.

# Protocol Specification

This section defines the operational procedures for the ACE-GF framework.
All cryptographic operations MUST follow the sequences described herein
to maintain cross-platform interoperability.

## Root Entropy Value (REV) Generation

This operation generates the Root Entropy Value (REV), which serves as
the atomic foundation of an ACE identity.

### Inputs

- None.

### Outputs

- **REV**: A freshly generated Root Entropy Value.
- **Error**: On failure.

### Processing Requirements

1. The REV MUST be a 256-bit (32-byte) value.
2. The REV MUST be sampled from a cryptographically secure random number
generator (CSPRNG) with uniform distribution.
3. The REV MUST NOT be stored in persistent storage in plaintext form.
It MUST exist only in volatile memory during active use.

### Error Conditions

- **EntropyUnavailable**: A suitable CSPRNG is not available or fails
to produce sufficient entropy.

### Error Handling Requirements

If REV generation fails, implementations MUST return an error and MUST
NOT proceed with any sealing or derivation operations.

## Sealing Process (Seal)

The Sealing process transforms a Root Entropy Value (REV) into a
persistent Sealed Artifact (SA) using an Authorization Credential.

### Inputs

- **REV**: The Root Entropy Value to be protected.
- **Authorization Credential (Cred)**: Secret material used to derive
the sealing key.
- **Sealing Profile**: Identifies the Argon2id parameters to be used.

### Outputs

- **Sealed Artifact (SA)**: A serialized artifact containing the
encrypted REV and associated metadata.
- **Error**: On failure.

### Processing Steps

1. Generate or select a 128-bit random Salt.
2. Derive the sealing key `K_seal` using Argon2id with the provided
Credential, Salt, and parameters defined by the selected Sealing
Profile.
3. Encrypt the REV using AES-256-GCM-SIV with `K_seal` and the fixed
nonce `N_fixed`.
4. Construct the Sealed Artifact (SA) by concatenating the Version,
ProfileID, Salt, Ciphertext, and Authentication Tag.
5. Zeroize the REV from volatile memory after successful sealing.

### Error Conditions

- **InvalidREV**: The supplied REV does not meet length or format
requirements.
- **ProfileUnsupported**: The specified Sealing Profile is not supported.
- **SealingFailure**: Encryption or key derivation fails.

### Error Handling Requirements

If sealing fails, implementations MUST return an error and MUST ensure
that the REV and any intermediate key material are not retained in
memory.

## Unsealing Process (Unseal)

The Unsealing process reconstructs the Root Entropy Value (REV) from a
provided Sealed Artifact (SA) and Authorization Credential.

### Inputs

- **Sealed Artifact (SA)**: A serialized artifact containing the encrypted
REV and associated metadata.
- **Authorization Credential (Cred)**: User- or system-provided secret
material required to derive the sealing key.

### Outputs

- **REV**: The reconstructed Root Entropy Value, on success.
- **Error**: On failure.

### Processing Steps

1. **Parse**: Extract the Version, ProfileID, Salt, Ciphertext, and
Authentication Tag from the SA.
2. **Derive**: Recompute the sealing key `K_seal` using the provided
Credential, extracted Salt, and the parameters associated with the
ProfileID.
3. **Decrypt**: Execute AES-256-GCM-SIV decryption on the Ciphertext using
`K_seal`, the fixed nonce `N_fixed`, and the Authentication Tag.

### Error Conditions

- **AuthenticationFailure**: Authentication tag verification fails.
- **InvalidFormat**: The SA cannot be parsed or contains unsupported
version or profile identifiers.
- **ProfileUnsupported**: The referenced ProfileID is not implemented.

### Error Handling Requirements

If any error occurs, implementations MUST return an error and MUST NOT
release any portion of the decrypted REV. Implementations SHOULD ensure
that error handling does not introduce observable timing differences
that could leak information about the Credential or `K_seal`.

## Key Derivation Function (Derive)

The Derive operation deterministically produces algorithm-specific
cryptographic key material from a reconstructed Root Entropy Value (REV).

### Inputs

- **REV**: The reconstructed Root Entropy Value.
- **Context Tuple (Ctx)**: A structured context specifying algorithm,
usage domain, and key index.
- **Output Length**: The required length of derived key material.

### Outputs

- **DerivedKey**: Algorithm-specific key material.
- **Error**: On failure.

### Processing Steps

1. Perform HKDF-Extract using the REV as input key material to produce a
pseudorandom key (PRK).
2. Perform HKDF-Expand using the PRK and the serialized Context Tuple
(`Ctx`) as the `info` parameter to generate key material of the
requested length.
3. Map the derived output to algorithm-specific key material according
to the target algorithm's requirements.

### Error Conditions

- **InvalidContext**: The Context Tuple is malformed or unsupported.
- **DerivationFailure**: HKDF expansion fails or produces invalid output
for the target algorithm.

### Error Handling Requirements

On failure, implementations MUST return an error and MUST NOT release
partial or malformed key material. The REV MUST remain protected in
volatile memory and SHOULD be zeroized once derivation operations are
complete.

# Data Structures and Encodings

## Sealed Artifact (SA) Binary Format

The Sealed Artifact (SA) is a serialized byte array that contains all necessary
metadata and encrypted data to reconstruct the Identity. All multi-byte
fields MUST be encoded in Big-Endian (Network Byte Order).

The SA structure is defined as follows:

| Offset | Length | Field         | Description                          |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| 0      | 4      | Magic Number  | Fixed bytes: 0x41 0x43 0x45 0x00 ('ACE\0') |
| 4      | 1      | Version       | Protocol version (currently 0x01)    |
| 5      | 1      | Profile ID    | Identifier for Sealing Profile       |
| 6      | 16     | Salt          | Random salt for Argon2id             |
| 22     | 32     | Ciphertext    | AES-GCM-SIV encrypted REV            |
| 54     | 16     | Tag           | Authentication Tag (MAC)             |

**Total Length: 70 Bytes.**

## Sealing Profiles

Sealing Profiles define the cost parameters for the Argon2id function. This
allows ACE-GF to scale from resource-constrained mobile devices to
high-security server environments.

| Profile ID | Label    | Memory (MiB) | Iterations (T) | Parallelism (P) |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0x01       | Mobile   | 64           | 3              | 1               |
| 0x02       | Standard | 256          | 4              | 2               |
| 0x03       | Paranoid | 1024         | 8              | 4               |

Implementations MUST support at least the 'Standard' (0x02) profile. The
'Paranoid' profile is RECOMMENDED for high-value administrative identities.

## Context Labels

To ensure computational independence between different cryptographic algorithms,
the `AlgID` field in the Context Tuple MUST use the following initial
registry. This ensures that a key derived for Ed25519 cannot be mistakenly
used or mathematically linked to a Secp256k1 key.

### Algorithm Identifiers (AlgID)

| AlgID  | Algorithm Name       | Reference |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| 0x01   | Ed25519              | RFC 8032  |
| 0x02   | Secp256k1 (ECDSA)    | SEC 2     |
| 0x03   | X25519 (Diffie-Hellman)| RFC 7748  |
| 0x04   | AES-256-GCM (Symmetric)| NIST SP800-38D |
| 0x05   | ML-DSA (Dilithium-PQC)| FIPS 204  |
| 0x06   | ML-KEM (Kyber-PQC)   | FIPS 203  |

### Usage Domains (Domain)

The 8-bit Domain field separates keys by their functional intent:

* **0x01 (Signing)**: Primary identity signatures.
* **0x02 (Encryption)**: Data at rest or in transit.
* **0x03 (Authentication)**: Challenge-response protocols.
* **0x04 (Key Wrapping)**: Protecting other sub-keys.

## Context Tuple Encoding

The Context Tuple (Ctx) is a compact, fixed-length binary structure
used as the `info` parameter for HKDF expansion. All fields are
encoded in Big-Endian (Network Byte Order).

### Context Tuple Binary Layout

| Offset | Length | Field   | Description                                  |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| 0      | 2      | AlgID   | Algorithm Identifier                          |
| 2      | 1      | Domain  | Usage Domain                                  |
| 3      | 4      | Index   | Key Index (unsigned integer)                 |

**Total Length: 7 bytes.**

### Encoding Rules

- The AlgID field MUST correspond to a registered value in the
ACE-GF Context Identifier Registry.
- The Domain field MUST correspond to a registered Usage Domain.
- The Index field is an unsigned 32-bit integer and MAY be incremented
to derive multiple independent keys within the same algorithm and
domain.

# Operational Considerations and Identity Lifecycle

This section describes operational aspects of deploying and managing
Atomic Cryptographic Entities (ACEs) using the ACE-GF framework. It
focuses on lifecycle management, authorization updates, revocation
semantics, and deployment considerations. This section is informational
and does not introduce new protocol requirements beyond those specified
elsewhere in this document.

One of the primary advantages of the ACE-GF framework is its ability to
manage the full identity lifecycle without requiring changes to the
underlying Root Entropy Value (REV). Authorization material may be
updated or revoked independently, while derived cryptographic
identifiers remain stable as long as the REV remains reachable.

## Stateless Credential Rotation

ACE-GF supports stateless credential rotation, allowing an entity to
update its Authorization Credential (e.g., changing a password or
authorization factor) without altering the underlying Root Entropy
Value (REV).

Because the REV is the sole source of all derived cryptographic keys,
this process preserves identity continuity. No derived public keys,
addresses, or identifiers need to be regenerated or re-announced.

The rotation process is performed as follows:

1. **Unseal**: Use the current Authorization Credential and the existing
Sealed Artifact (SA) to reconstruct the REV in volatile memory.
2. **Generate New Salt**: Sample a new 128-bit random salt value.
3. **Re-Seal**: Perform the Sealing Process (as defined in Section 4.2)
using the new Authorization Credential and the new salt, while
maintaining the same REV.
4. **Commit**: Replace the previous SA with the newly generated SA.

This operation is stateless with respect to identity semantics. No
persistent state other than the updated SA is required, and no protocol-
visible identity attributes are modified.

## Authorization-Bound Revocation

ACE-GF enables immediate and intrinsic revocation through
authorization-bound revocation. Revocation is achieved by rendering the
REV mathematically unreachable rather than by relying on external
revocation infrastructure.

In high-security deployments, the Authorization Pipeline MAY be
distributed across multiple components, such as a user-held credential
combined with a server-held secret or policy-controlled input.

Revocation may be performed using one or more of the following actions:

1. **Revocation by Destruction**: Destroying the associated Sealed
Artifact (SA).
2. **Credential Component Removal**: Removing or invalidating a required
authorization input (e.g., server-held secret or credential factor).

Once revocation has occurred, reconstruction of the REV becomes
cryptographically infeasible. As a result:

- No derived keys can be regenerated.
- No partial identity state is exposed.
- No external revocation mechanisms (such as CRLs or OCSP) are required.

The identity remains offline until valid authorization inputs are
restored, such as by deploying a backup SA under the control of the
authorizing entity.

## Failure Modes and Recovery Considerations

Failure to reconstruct the REV may occur due to incorrect credentials,
corrupted Sealed Artifacts, unsupported sealing profiles, or intentional
revocation actions.

Implementations SHOULD treat all unsealing failures as indistinguishable
from an external observability perspective and MUST NOT leak partial
information about the REV or derived keys in failure scenarios.

Recovery is possible only if sufficient authorization material remains
available. Loss of all authorization inputs results in permanent
unreachability of the REV.

## Storage and Ephemeral State Considerations

The Root Entropy Value (REV) is intended to exist only in volatile memory
during active operations and MUST NOT be persistently stored.

The Sealed Artifact (SA) is the sole persistent representation required
to reconstruct an ACE identity. It MAY be stored, transmitted, or backed
up using conventional storage mechanisms, subject to application-specific
security policies.

Implementations SHOULD ensure timely zeroization of all sensitive
material, including the REV, sealing keys, and intermediate buffers,
after use. Where available, hardware-backed isolation mechanisms such as
Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are RECOMMENDED to reduce exposure
risk during reconstruction and derivation operations.

## Migration Considerations

Existing cryptographic identities MAY be migrated into the ACE-GF
framework by treating a legacy high-entropy private key as a Root
Entropy Value (REV) and sealing it using standard ACE-GF procedures.

Such migrations are OPTIONAL and profile-dependent. Implementations
SHOULD document any deviations from native ACE-GF derivation semantics
and SHOULD clearly distinguish between natively generated ACE-GF
identities and migrated identities when relevant.


# Security Considerations

The security of the ACE-GF framework depends on the strength of the underlying
cryptographic primitives and the rigor of the implementation environment.

## Entropy Requirements for Credentials

The security of the Sealed Artifact (SA) is directly proportional to the
entropy of the Authorization Credential (Cred).

1.  **Minimum Entropy**: Human-provided credentials SHOULD be long, randomly
generated passphrases managed by password managers. Machine-generated
credentials MUST provide at least 128 bits of entropy.
2.  **Entropy Stretching**: While Argon2id provides significant resistance
against brute-force, it cannot compensate for extremely weak secrets
(e.g., short, common passwords).
3.  **Machine-Generated Credentials**: For Autonomous Digital Entities (ADEs),
credentials MUST be generated using a CSPRNG.

## Side-Channel Protections and Memory Management

Since the Root Entropy Value (REV) is the "single source of truth" for the
entire identity, its exposure in volatile memory must be strictly controlled.

### Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)
Implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to perform the Unsealing and
Derivation processes within a hardware-isolated Trusted Execution
Environment (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, or AWS Nitro Enclaves).
This ensures that even a compromised host OS cannot observe the REV or
the intermediate Sealing Key (K_seal).

### Memory Zeroization
To prevent "cold boot" attacks or memory forensics, implementations MUST
ensure that:
1.  All memory buffers containing the REV, K_seal, or raw Credentials
are overwritten with zeros (Zeroization) immediately after use.
2.  Memory pages used for these secrets SHOULD be marked as non-swappable
(e.g., using `mlock` on POSIX systems) to prevent sensitive data
from being written to a persistent swap file.

## Resistance to Brute-Force Attacks

The use of Argon2id allows ACE-GF to scale its defense according to the
threat model. The following table provides a theoretical analysis of
attack costs across different Profiles:

| Profile | Target Device | Attacker Cost Assumption (Memory-Hardness) |
|---------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|

## Post-Quantum Transition and Hybrid Security

ACE-GF is designed with "Algorithm Agility" to survive the transition to
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

1.  **Context-Isolated PQC**: As defined in Section 5.3, the framework
allows the derivation of PQC keys (e.g., ML-DSA) alongside classical
keys (e.g., Ed25519) from the same REV.
2.  **Hybrid Derivation**: For maximum security during the transition
period, implementations MAY use a hybrid approach where a classical
signature and a PQC signature are required to authorize a single
action.
3.  **Future-Proofing REV**: Because the REV is a high-entropy (256-bit)
random value, it is considered "Quantum-Safe" against Grover's
algorithm, providing a 128-bit security margin even in a
post-quantum world.

## Note on AES-GCM-SIV and Fixed Nonce

The use of a fixed all-zero nonce (N_fixed) in Section 4.2.2 is safe
specifically because the plaintext being encrypted (the REV) is
guaranteed to be a unique, high-entropy 256-bit value for every
Sealed Artifact. Therefore, the SIV (Synthetic Initialization Vector)
derivation will inherently produce unique sub-keys for the underlying
CTR mode, preventing the catastrophic key-stream reuse associated
with standard AES-GCM.


# IANA Considerations

This section describes a proposed registry structure. Creation of IANA
registries is contingent on the publication status of this document.

This document requests IANA to create two new registries for the Atomic
Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework (ACE-GF).

## ACE-GF Sealing Profile Registry

IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "ACE-GF Sealing
Profiles". This registry manages the parameter sets for the credential
hashing function (Argon2id).

The registration policy for this registry is "Specification Required"
as defined in [RFC8126].

Initial entries for this registry are as follows:

| Profile ID | Label    | Memory (MiB) | Iterations (T) | Parallelism (P) | Reference |
|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| 0x01       | Mobile   | 64           | 3              | 1               | [This RFC]|
| 0x02       | Standard | 256          | 4              | 2               | [This RFC]|
| 0x03       | Paranoid | 1024         | 8              | 4               | [This RFC]|
| 0x04-0xFF  | Unassigned|             |                |                 |           |

## ACE-GF Context Identifier Registry

IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "ACE-GF Context
Identifiers". This registry manages the Algorithm Identifiers (AlgID)
used in the key derivation context string.

The registration policy for this registry is "Expert Review" as defined
in [RFC8126].

Initial entries for this registry are as follows:

| AlgID     | Algorithm Name          | Reference |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 0x0001    | Ed25519                 | RFC 8032  |
| 0x0002    | Secp256k1               | SEC 2     |
| 0x0003    | X25519                  | RFC 7748  |
| 0x0004    | AES-256-GCM             | NIST SP800-38D |
| 0x0005    | ML-DSA (Dilithium)      | FIPS 204  |
| 0x0006    | ML-KEM (Kyber)          | FIPS 203  |
| 0x0007-0xFFFF | Unassigned          |           |

## ACE-GF Usage Domain Registry

IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "ACE-GF Usage Domains".
This registry manages the 8-bit Domain field.

| Domain ID | Description             | Reference |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 0x01      | Signing                 | [This RFC]|
| 0x02      | Encryption              | [This RFC]|
| 0x03      | Authentication          | [This RFC]|
| 0x04      | Key Wrapping            | [This RFC]|
| 0x05-0xFF | Unassigned              |           |

# Test Vectors

This section defines test vectors intended to verify the correctness
and interoperability of ACE-GF implementations.

Unless otherwise stated, the test vectors in Sections 10.1 through
10.3 define normative behavior for conforming ACE-GF implementations.
Test vectors associated with specific Application Profiles are
informational unless explicitly required by that profile.

## Application Profile Test Vectors (Informational)

### Cryptocurrency Wallet Application Profile

This section defines test vectors for the **ACE-GF Cryptocurrency Wallet
Application Profile**.

These test vectors are intended to demonstrate the deterministic behavior
of ACE-GF when applied to a multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet context,
including mnemonic generation, passphrase-based rekeying, identity
reconstruction ("view"), and migration from legacy wallet mnemonics.

These vectors **DO NOT** validate the ACE-GF protocol encoding, wire format,
or generic file representations defined elsewhere in this document.
Instead, they apply exclusively to implementations that claim conformance
to the wallet application profile.

Implementations that do not support this application profile are not
required to produce identical results.

The following test vectors are expressed in JSON format for readability
and ease of cross-platform testing.

## 10.5. Interoperability Verification Guidance

An implementation claiming conformance to this specification SHOULD
verify interoperability as follows:

1. Using the test vectors in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, confirm that:
- The reconstructed REV exactly matches the expected value.
- The serialized Sealed Artifact (SA) fields match the specified
binary layout and contents.
2. Using the vectors in Section 10.3, confirm that:
- Derived key material for different algorithms and domains is
deterministic and context-isolated.
- Classical and post-quantum derivations can coexist under the same REV.
3. Implementations supporting the Cryptocurrency Wallet Application
Profile SHOULD additionally verify conformance using the vectors
defined in Section 10.4.

Successful verification across independent implementations indicates
interoperability of the ACE-GF construction.

# Implementation Considerations for Resource-Constrained Devices

For IoT devices with limited RAM that cannot support the 'Standard' Argon2id
profile (256 MiB), the following optimizations are RECOMMENDED:

1.  **Offloading Sealing**: The Sealing process can be performed on a
provisioning terminal. The device only needs to store the resulting
Sealed Artifact (SA).
2.  **Unsealing via TEE**: If the device features a Secure Element (SE) or
TEE, the K_seal derivation SHOULD be pinned to the hardware UID to
provide an additional layer of security even if the Credential is weak.

# Python Reference Implementation

A simplified reference implementation of the ACE-GF derivation logic:

    import hashlib
    import hmac

    def hkdf_expand(prk, info, length):
      t = b""
      okm = b""
      for i in range((length + 31) // 32):
        t = hmac.new(prk, t + info + bytes([i + 1]), hashlib.sha256).digest()
        okm += t
      return okm[:length]

    # Example Context Construction
    alg_id = (1).to_bytes(2, 'big')   # Ed25519
    domain = (1).to_bytes(1, 'big')   # Signing
    index  = (0).to_bytes(4, 'big')   # Index 0
    ctx_info = alg_id + domain + index

    # prk = hkdf_extract(salt=0, ikm=REV)
    # derived_key = hkdf_expand(prk, ctx_info, 32)

# Example Use Cases (Informational)

This appendix provides illustrative, non-normative examples of how
the ACE-GF framework may be applied in different deployment contexts.
These examples are intended to aid understanding and do not impose
additional protocol requirements.

## Autonomous Digital Entities (ADEs)

Autonomous Digital Entities such as AI agents may require a stable
cryptographic identity that can be deterministically reconstructed
across restarts without persistent secret storage.

In such deployments:
- The Sealed Artifact (SA) may be stored in local or remote storage.
- Authorization Credentials may be supplied at runtime by a controller
or policy engine.
- Derived keys may be used for signing, authentication, or secure
communication between agents.

## IoT and Embedded Devices

IoT devices often operate under memory and storage constraints and may
lack secure persistent storage for long-lived secrets.

ACE-GF allows:
- Off-device provisioning of Sealed Artifacts.
- On-device reconstruction of identity only when required.
- Integration with Secure Elements or TEEs where available.

## Blockchain and Cryptographic Wallet Identities

Cryptographic wallets may use ACE-GF to derive multiple algorithm-
specific keys (e.g., Ed25519, secp256k1, PQC) from a single REV.

Stateless rekeying allows credential updates without changing public
addresses, while authorization-bound revocation provides a recovery
and lockout mechanism without external revocation infrastructure.

# Security Boundaries and Trust Assumptions (Informational)

This appendix summarizes the security boundaries and trust assumptions
implicit in the ACE-GF framework. It is informational and complements
the Security Considerations section.

## Trust Boundaries

ACE-GF assumes a clear separation between:
- Authorization inputs (Credentials, salts, policy-controlled inputs)
- Identity material (REV and derived keys)
- Persistent storage (Sealed Artifacts)

The compromise of persistent storage alone does not reveal the REV or
derived keys.

## Authorization Boundary

Authorization Credentials are assumed to be protected by the
application or deployment environment. Weak credentials reduce the
effective security of the Sealing Process but do not compromise the
cryptographic soundness of the framework.

## Execution Environment Assumptions

During unsealing and derivation, the execution environment is assumed
to provide basic process isolation. Where stronger guarantees are
required, hardware-backed isolation (e.g., TEEs) is RECOMMENDED.

## Non-Goals

ACE-GF does not attempt to:
- Protect against fully compromised execution environments.
- Provide anonymity or unlinkability guarantees.
- Replace application-level access control or policy enforcement.
