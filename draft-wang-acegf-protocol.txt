    ACE-GF: A Generative Framework for Atomic Cryptographic Entities
                    draft-wang-acegf-protocol-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative
   Framework (ACE-GF), a cryptographic construction for deriving and
   reconstructing stable digital identities from user-held credentials
   without requiring persistent storage of a master secret.

   ACE-GF addresses a structural limitation of existing deterministic
   key-derivation and identity systems, which rely on long-lived root
   secrets and rigid derivation hierarchies.  By separating identity
   reconstruction from long-term secret storage, ACE-GF enables
   stateless identity recovery, credential rekeying, and context-
   isolated derivation across multiple cryptographic algorithms.

   The framework is designed to be application-agnostic and may be
   applied to diverse environments such as authentication systems,
   distributed identities, secure key management, and cryptographic
   wallets.  This document defines the core construction, security
   properties, and interoperability considerations of ACE-GF, while
   application-specific profiles are defined separately.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Background and Motivation

   Deterministic key management schemes, such as BIP-32 and BIP-39, have
   simplified key recovery by deriving keys from a single
   [cite_start]master seed[cite: 18].  However, these schemes rely on
   the long-term persistent storage of that seed, which constitutes
   [cite_start]a single point of failure (SPOF)[cite: 19, 20].  If the
   seed [cite_start]is compromised, all derived keys are irreversibly
   exposed[cite: 21].

   This storage-centric design is ill-suited for Autonomous Digital
   Entities (ADEs), such as AI agents and IoT deployments, which require
   identity continuity without centralized trust
   [cite_start]anchors[cite: 22, 23].  ACE-GF addresses these challenges
   by decoupling deterministic identity from long-term secret
   [cite_start]storage[cite: 25].

1.2.  Core Contributions

   ACE-GF introduces a generative framework for Atomic Cryptographic
   Entities (ACE) with the following properties:

   *  *Seed-Storage-Free*: The identity root (REV) exists only
      [cite_start]ephemerally in memory[cite: 29].

   *  *Deterministic Reconstruction*: The REV is reconstructed
      [cite_start]from a sealed artifact and authorization
      credentials[cite: 30].

   *  *Context Isolation*: Cryptographic keys are isolated across
      algorithms (e.g., Ed25519, PQC) using explicit [cite_start]context
      encoding[cite: 33].

1.3.  Terminology

   The following terms are used throughout this document:

   *ACE-GF*  Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework.  A
      cryptographic framework that enables deterministic reconstruction
      of digital identities from user-held credentials without requiring
      persistent storage of a master secret.

   *Credential*  A user-provided secret input to ACE-GF, such as a
      passphrase, mnemonic, or other high-entropy material.  Credentials
      are supplied at the time of identity reconstruction and are not
      persistently stored by the framework.

   *Identity*  A stable cryptographic identity derived via ACE-GF.  An
      identity may correspond to one or more public/private key pairs,
      addresses, or identifiers, depending on the application context in
      which ACE-GF is applied.

   *Context*  An explicit domain-separation parameter used by ACE-GF to
      ensure that derived material for different purposes, algorithms,
      or applications remains cryptographically isolated.

   *Rekeying*  The process of changing credentials associated with an
      existing identity while preserving the underlying identity
      semantics.  In ACE-GF, rekeying does not require persistent state
      or regeneration of the identity.

   *Profile*  A specification that defines how ACE-GF is applied within
      a specific application domain.  Profiles may impose additional
      constraints, parameters, or output formats, but do not modify the
      core ACE-GF construction defined in this document.

   *Wallet Application Profile*  An application profile that applies
      ACE-GF to cryptocurrency wallet systems, including multi-algorithm
      key derivation and migration from legacy wallet formats.  This
      profile is illustrative and does not constrain other applications
      of ACE-GF.

2.  Architecture and Design Principles

   ACE-GF separates the identity lifecycle into two distinct pipelines:

2.1.  Identity Pipeline

   The identity pipeline manages the transformation from the REV to
   application-specific keys.  It utilizes a deterministic, one-way
   derivation function (HKDF) combined with explicit context strings.
   This ensures that compromise of a specific child key (e.g., an
   Ed25519 signing key) does not leak information about the REV or other
   sibling keys.

2.2.  Authorization Pipeline

   The authorization pipeline manages the secure "sealing" and
   "unsealing" of the REV.  By utilizing Argon2id for memory-hard key
   stretching and AES-GCM-SIV for nonce-misuse resistant encryption, the
   framework ensures that the REV is only accessible when the correct
   Credential is provided.

3.  Cryptographic Primitives

   The ACE-GF framework relies on industry-proven cryptographic
   primitives.  Implementations MUST strictly adhere to the selection of
   these primitives to ensure deterministic consistency across different
   platforms and environments.

3.1.  KDF1: Credential Hashing (Argon2id)

   To resist offline brute-force attacks, ACE-GF utilizes the Argon2id
   algorithm [RFC9106] for stretching user-provided credentials (Cred)
   into a symmetric sealing key (K_seal).

   *  *Algorithm Selection*: Implementations MUST use the Argon2id
      variant (as opposed to Argon2i or Argon2d) to provide optimized
      protection against both side-channel attacks and GPU-based
      cracking.

   *  *Parameter Negotiation*: Implementations SHOULD support pre-
      defined Sealing Profiles that specify memory cost (M), time
      iterations (T), and parallelism (P).

   *  *Salt*: Each Sealed Artifact (SA) MUST include a unique 128-bit
      random salt to ensure that identical credentials result in unique
      sealing keys.

3.2.  AEAD: Sealing Encryption (AES-GCM-SIV)

   ACE-GF employs AES-GCM-SIV [RFC8452] for the authenticated encryption
   of the Root Entropy Value (REV).

   *  *Misuse Resistance*: AES-GCM-SIV is selected for its Synthetic
      Initialization Vector (SIV) properties.  In the specific context
      of ACE-GF, given that the REV is a 256-bit high-entropy random
      value, using a fixed 96-bit all-zero nonce (N_fixed) is safe under
      the assumption that the plaintext (REV) is a uniformly random,
      high-entropy value and that the sealing key is not reused for
      arbitrary plaintexts.  This assumption holds exclusively for the
      sealing of REV values and MUST NOT be generalized to arbitrary
      data encryption use cases.

   *  *Security Assurance*: The use of AES-GCM-SIV prevents
      confidentiality leaks even in cases of nonce reuse, eliminating
      the dependency on high-fidelity hardware Random Number Generators
      (RNG) during every sealing operation.

   *  *Data Structure*: The encryption process MUST produce a 256-bit
      ciphertext and a 128-bit authentication tag.

3.3.  KDF2: Key Derivation (HKDF-SHA256)

   For deriving algorithm-specific keys from the REV, ACE-GF utilizes
   HKDF [RFC5869].

   *  *Core Logic*: The standard Extract-then-Expand workflow is
      followed.

   *  *Extract*: Map the REV into a cryptographically strong
      Pseudorandom Key (PRK).

   *  *Expand*: Input the structured Context tuple (Ctx) as the 'info'
      parameter to generate target keys of specific lengths.

   *  *Hash Function*: SHA-256 MUST be used.

   *  *Isolation Guarantee*: By explicitly encoding AlgID, Domain, and
      Index into the 'info' string, HKDF ensures that the resulting
      child keys are computationally independent.

4.  Protocol Specification

   This section defines the operational procedures for the ACE-GF
   framework.  All cryptographic operations MUST follow the sequences
   described herein to maintain cross-platform interoperability.

4.1.  Root Entropy Value (REV) Generation

   The Root Entropy Value (REV) serves as the atomic foundation of an
   Identity.

   1.  The REV MUST be a 256-bit (32-byte) value.

   2.  The REV MUST be sampled from a cryptographically secure random
       number generator (CSPRNG) with uniform distribution.

   3.  The REV MUST NOT be stored in persistent storage in its raw form.
       It MUST only exist in volatile memory during active use and
       SHOULD be zeroized immediately after the Sealing or Derivation
       process.

4.2.  Sealing Process (Seal)

   The Sealing process transforms the REV into a persistent Sealed
   Artifact (SA) using an Authorization Credential.

4.2.1.  Sealing Key Derivation (K_seal)

   To derive the symmetric sealing key: 1.  Generate or retrieve a
   128-bit random Salt. 2.  Input the user Credential, Salt, and
   selected Sealing Profile parameters into the Argon2id function. 3.
   The output MUST be a 256-bit key, designated as K_seal.

4.2.2.  Deterministic Encryption Steps (N_fixed)

   Once K_seal is derived, the REV is encrypted as follows: 1.
   *Algorithm*: AES-256-GCM-SIV. 2.  *Nonce (N_fixed)*: A fixed 96-bit
   (12-byte) all-zero value.  The use of a fixed nonce is permitted here
   because the REV itself provides the necessary entropy for the SIV
   construction. 3.  *Operation*: Encrypt the REV using K_seal and
   N_fixed. 4.  *Output*: A 256-bit Ciphertext and a 128-bit
   Authentication Tag.

   The resulting *Sealed Artifact (SA)* is the concatenation of:
   Version || ProfileID || Salt || Ciphertext || Tag

4.3.  Unsealing Process (Unseal)

   The Unsealing process reconstructs the REV from a provided SA and
   Credential.

   1.  *Parse*: Extract the Version, ProfileID, Salt, Ciphertext, and
       Tag from the SA.

   2.  *Derive*: Recompute K_seal using the Credential, Salt, and the
       parameters defined by the ProfileID.

   3.  *Decrypt*: Execute AES-256-GCM-SIV decryption on the Ciphertext
       using K_seal, N_fixed, and the Tag.

   4.  *Failure Handling*: If the authentication tag verification fails,
       the implementation MUST return an error and MUST NOT release any
       part of the decrypted data.  The process SHOULD include a
       protection mechanism against timing attacks.

4.4.  Key Derivation Function (Derive)

   The Derive function generates application-specific keys from the REV.

4.4.1.  Context Tuple Structure

   To ensure deterministic and isolated derivation, a structured
   *Context Tuple (Ctx)* is defined:

   *  *AlgID (16-bit)*: Identifies the target algorithm (e.g., Ed25519).

   *  *Domain (8-bit)*: Specifies the usage domain (e.g., 0x01 for
      Signing, 0x02 for Encryption).

   *  *Index (32-bit)*: An incremental counter allowing for virtually
      unlimited keys per algorithm/domain.

   The Ctx MUST be serialized into a consistent byte string before being
   used as the 'info' parameter in HKDF.

4.4.2.  Computational Independence Guarantee

   The derivation follows the HKDF-SHA256 Extract-and-Expand logic: 1.
   PRK = HKDF-Extract(Salt=0, IKM=REV) 2.  DerivedKey = HKDF-Expand(PRK,
   info=Ctx, output_length)

   Given that the REV is a uniformly random 256-bit value, a zero-length
   salt is sufficient for HKDF-Extract; implementations MAY
   alternatively use a fixed protocol-specific salt string for explicit
   domain separation.

   By including the AlgID and Domain in the 'info' parameter, the
   framework guarantees that a compromise of one DerivedKey provides no
   computational advantage in recovering the REV or any other DerivedKey
   associated with a different Ctx.

4.4.3.  Algorithm-Specific Key Material Mapping

   The output of HKDF-Expand (DerivedKey) MUST be mapped to algorithm-
   specific key material according to the requirements of the target
   algorithm.

   *  *Ed25519*: The 32-byte DerivedKey MUST be used as the Ed25519
      private key seed as specified in RFC 8032.

   *  *X25519*: The DerivedKey MUST be interpreted as a 32-byte scalar
      and clamped as specified in RFC 7748.

   *  *secp256k1 (ECDSA)*: The DerivedKey MUST be interpreted as a big-
      endian integer and reduced modulo the curve order.  If the
      resulting value is zero, the implementation MUST re-derive key
      material using an incremented internal counter.

   *  *ML-DSA (Dilithium)* and *ML-KEM (Kyber)*: The DerivedKey MUST be
      used as deterministic seed input to the key generation procedures
      defined in FIPS 204 and FIPS 203, respectively.

5.  Data Structures and Encodings

5.1.  Sealed Artifact (SA) Binary Format

   The Sealed Artifact (SA) is a serialized byte array that contains all
   necessary metadata and encrypted data to reconstruct the Identity.
   All multi-byte fields MUST be encoded in Big-Endian (Network Byte
   Order).

   The SA structure is defined as follows:

        +========+========+==============+========================+
        | Offset | Length | Field        | Description            |
        +========+========+==============+========================+
        | 0      | 4      | Magic Number | Fixed bytes: 0x41 0x43 |
        |        |        |              | 0x45 0x00 ('ACE\0')    |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+
        | 4      | 1      | Version      | Protocol version       |
        |        |        |              | (currently 0x01)       |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+
        | 5      | 1      | Profile ID   | Identifier for Sealing |
        |        |        |              | Profile                |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+
        | 6      | 16     | Salt         | Random salt for        |
        |        |        |              | Argon2id               |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+
        | 22     | 32     | Ciphertext   | AES-GCM-SIV encrypted  |
        |        |        |              | REV                    |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+
        | 54     | 16     | Tag          | Authentication Tag     |
        |        |        |              | (MAC)                  |
        +--------+--------+--------------+------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   *Total Length: 70 Bytes.*

5.2.  Sealing Profiles

   Sealing Profiles define the cost parameters for the Argon2id
   function.  This allows ACE-GF to scale from resource-constrained
   mobile devices to high-security server environments.

    +============+==========+==============+============+=============+
    | Profile ID | Label    | Memory (MiB) | Iterations | Parallelism |
    |            |          |              | (T)        | (P)         |
    +============+==========+==============+============+=============+
    | 0x01       | Mobile   | 64           | 3          | 1           |
    +------------+----------+--------------+------------+-------------+
    | 0x02       | Standard | 256          | 4          | 2           |
    +------------+----------+--------------+------------+-------------+
    | 0x03       | Paranoid | 1024         | 8          | 4           |
    +------------+----------+--------------+------------+-------------+

                                  Table 2

   Implementations MUST support at least the 'Standard' (0x02) profile.
   The 'Paranoid' profile is RECOMMENDED for high-value administrative
   identities.

5.3.  Context Labels

   To ensure computational independence between different cryptographic
   algorithms, the AlgID field in the Context Tuple MUST use the
   following initial registry.  This ensures that a key derived for
   Ed25519 cannot be mistakenly used or mathematically linked to a
   Secp256k1 key.

5.3.1.  Algorithm Identifiers (AlgID)

           +=======+=========================+================+
           | AlgID | Algorithm Name          | Reference      |
           +=======+=========================+================+
           | 0x01  | Ed25519                 | RFC 8032       |
           +-------+-------------------------+----------------+
           | 0x02  | Secp256k1 (ECDSA)       | SEC 2          |

           +-------+-------------------------+----------------+

                                 Table 3

5.3.2.  Usage Domains (Domain)

   The 8-bit Domain field separates keys by their functional intent:

   *  *0x01 (Signing)*: Primary identity signatures.

   *  *0x02 (Encryption)*: Data at rest or in transit.

   *  *0x03 (Authentication)*: Challenge-response protocols.

   *  *0x04 (Key Wrapping)*: Protecting other sub-keys.

6.  Identity Lifecycle Operations

   One of the primary advantages of the ACE-GF framework is its ability
   to manage the identity lifecycle without requiring changes to the
   underlying root entropy.  This section defines the procedures for
   credential management and migration.

6.1.  Stateless Credential Rotation

   Stateless Credential Rotation allows an entity to update its
   Authorization Credential (e.g., changing a password) without altering
   the Root Entropy Value (REV).  Because the REV is the source of all
   derived keys, this process ensures that the ACE's identity and all
   its associated cryptographic keys remain stable.

   The rotation process is performed as follows: 1.  *Unseal*: Use the
   current Credential and the existing Sealed Artifact (SA) to
   reconstruct the REV in volatile memory. 2.  *Generate New Salt*:
   Sample a new 128-bit random Salt. 3.  *Re-Seal*: Perform the Sealing
   Process (as defined in Section 4.2) using the _new_ Credential and
   the _new_ Salt, while maintaining the _same_ REV. 4.  *Commit*:
   Replace the old SA with the newly generated SA.

   This operation is "stateless" from the perspective of the identity
   foundation; no derived keys (e.g., blockchain addresses or SSH keys)
   need to be updated or re-announced to the network.

6.2.  Authorization-Bound Revocation

   ACE-GF supports a unique mechanism for immediate revocation by
   decoupling the components required for REV reconstruction.

   In high-security deployments, the Authorization Pipeline can be
   distributed across multiple components (e.g., a user-held password
   and a server-held secret).

   1.  *Revocation by Destruction*: To revoke access to an ACE, the
       controlling entity simply destroys the associated Sealed Artifact
       (SA) or the server-held component of the Credential.

   2.  *Immediate Effect*: Without the SA or the specific Credential
       salt, the REV becomes mathematically unreachable.

   3.  *No CRL/OCSP Required*: Unlike traditional certificate-based
       revocation, this is an inherent cryptographic lock.  Once the
       "pathway" to the REV is broken, the identity is effectively
       offline until a backup SA (if any) is deployed.

6.3.  Legacy Key Migration (Optional)

   To facilitate the adoption of ACE-GF by existing systems, it is
   possible to "wrap" legacy private keys into the framework.

   Instead of generating a random 256-bit REV as described in
   Section 4.1, an implementation MAY: 1.  Take an existing high-entropy
   private key (the "Legacy Key"). 2.  Treat this Legacy Key as the REV.
   3.  Proceed with the Sealing Process (Section 4.2) to create an SA.

   This allows the legacy key to benefit from the "Seed-Storage-Free"
   properties of ACE-GF.  However, implementations SHOULD note that keys
   imported this way might not follow the strict context-isolation
   properties defined for native ACE-GF derived keys.

7.  Security Considerations

   The security of the ACE-GF framework depends on the strength of the
   underlying cryptographic primitives and the rigor of the
   implementation environment.

7.1.  Entropy Requirements for Credentials

   The security of the Sealed Artifact (SA) is directly proportional to
   the entropy of the Authorization Credential (Cred).

   1.  *Minimum Entropy*: Human-provided credentials SHOULD be long,
       randomly generated passphrases managed by password managers.
       Machine-generated credentials MUST provide at least 128 bits of
       entropy.

   2.  *Entropy Stretching*: While Argon2id provides significant
       resistance against brute-force, it cannot compensate for
       extremely weak secrets (e.g., short, common passwords).

   3.  *Machine-Generated Credentials*: For Autonomous Digital Entities
       (ADEs), credentials MUST be generated using a CSPRNG.

7.2.  Side-Channel Protections and Memory Management

   Since the Root Entropy Value (REV) is the "single source of truth"
   for the entire identity, its exposure in volatile memory must be
   strictly controlled.

7.2.1.  Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)

   Implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to perform the Unsealing and
   Derivation processes within a hardware-isolated Trusted Execution
   Environment (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone, or AWS Nitro Enclaves).
   This ensures that even a compromised host OS cannot observe the REV
   or the intermediate Sealing Key (K_seal).

7.2.2.  Memory Zeroization

   To prevent "cold boot" attacks or memory forensics, implementations
   MUST ensure that: 1.  All memory buffers containing the REV, K_seal,
   or raw Credentials are overwritten with zeros (Zeroization)
   immediately after use. 2.  Memory pages used for these secrets SHOULD
   be marked as non-swappable (e.g., using mlock on POSIX systems) to
   prevent sensitive data from being written to a persistent swap file.

7.3.  Resistance to Brute-Force Attacks

   The use of Argon2id allows ACE-GF to scale its defense according to
   the threat model.  The following table provides a theoretical
   analysis of attack costs across different Profiles:

   +==========+===========+============================================+
   | Profile  | Target    | Attacker Cost Assumption (Memory-          |
   |          | Device    | Hardness)                                  |
   +==========+===========+============================================+
   | Mobile   | Low-Power | Balanced for battery life;                 |
   |          | IoT       | vulnerable to high-end GPU                 |
   |          |           | clusters.                                  |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Standard | Desktop/  | Resistant to mid-scale commodity           |
   |          | Web       | GPU attacks.                               |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | Paranoid | Server/   | Prohibitively expensive for all            |
   |          | HSM       | but state-actor level adversaries          |
   |          |           | due to high memory bandwidth               |
   |          |           | requirements (1GB+ per attempt).           |
   +----------+-----------+--------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 4

7.4.  Post-Quantum Transition and Hybrid Security

   ACE-GF is designed with "Algorithm Agility" to survive the transition
   to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

   1.  *Context-Isolated PQC*: As defined in Section 5.3, the framework
       allows the derivation of PQC keys (e.g., ML-DSA) alongside
       classical keys (e.g., Ed25519) from the same REV.

   2.  *Hybrid Derivation*: For maximum security during the transition
       period, implementations MAY use a hybrid approach where a
       classical signature and a PQC signature are required to authorize
       a single action.

   3.  *Future-Proofing REV*: Because the REV is a high-entropy
       (256-bit) random value, it is considered "Quantum-Safe" against
       Grover's algorithm, providing a 128-bit security margin even in a
       post-quantum world.

7.5.  Note on AES-GCM-SIV and Fixed Nonce

   The use of a fixed all-zero nonce (N_fixed) in Section 4.2.2 is safe
   specifically because the plaintext being encrypted (the REV) is
   guaranteed to be a unique, high-entropy 256-bit value for every
   Sealed Artifact.  Therefore, the SIV (Synthetic Initialization
   Vector) derivation will inherently produce unique sub-keys for the
   underlying CTR mode, preventing the catastrophic key-stream reuse
   associated with standard AES-GCM.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes a proposed registry structure.  Creation of
   IANA registries is contingent on the publication status of this
   document.

   This document requests IANA to create two new registries for the
   Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework (ACE-GF).

8.1.  ACE-GF Sealing Profile Registry

   IANA is requested to create a new registry entitled "ACE-GF Sealing
   Profiles".  This registry manages the parameter sets for the
   credential hashing function (Argon2id).

   Identifiers".  This registry manages the Algorithm Identifiers
   (AlgID) used in the key derivation context string.

9.4.  Cryptocurrency Wallet Application Profile Test Vectors

   This section defines test vectors for the *ACE-GF Cryptocurrency
   Wallet Application Profile*.

   These test vectors are intended to demonstrate the deterministic
   behavior of ACE-GF when applied to a multi-chain cryptocurrency
   wallet context, including mnemonic generation, passphrase-based
   rekeying, identity reconstruction ("view"), and migration from legacy
   wallet mnemonics.

   These vectors *DO NOT* validate the ACE-GF protocol encoding, wire
   format, or generic file representations defined elsewhere in this
   document.  Instead, they apply exclusively to implementations that
   claim conformance to the wallet application profile.

   Implementations that do not support this application profile are not
   required to produce identical results.

   The following test vectors are expressed in JSON format for
   readability and ease of cross-platform testing.

Appendix A.  Appendix A.  Implementation Considerations for Resource-
             Constrained Devices

   For IoT devices with limited RAM that cannot support the 'Standard'
   Argon2id profile (256 MiB), the following optimizations are
   RECOMMENDED:

   1.  *Offloading Sealing*: The Sealing process can be performed on a
       provisioning terminal.  The device only needs to store the
       resulting Sealed Artifact (SA).

   2.  *Unsealing via TEE*: If the device features a Secure Element (SE)
       or TEE, the K_seal derivation SHOULD be pinned to the hardware
       UID to provide an additional layer of security even if the
       Credential is weak.

Appendix B.  Appendix B.  Python Reference Implementation

   A simplified reference implementation of the ACE-GF derivation logic:

   def hkdf_expand(prk, info, length): t = b"" okm = b"" for i in
   range((length + 31) // 32): t = hmac.new(prk, t + info + bytes([i +
   1]), hashlib.sha256).digest() okm += t return okm[:length]

   'big') # Signing index = (0).to_bytes(4, 'big') # Index 0 ctx_info =
   alg_id + domain + index

Appendix D.  prk = hkdf_extract(salt=0, ikm=REV)

   # derived_key = hkdf_expand(prk, ctx_info, 32)
